# BreadWinner
### The easy-to-use bread making application.

BreadWinner can be used as an assistant tool to guide users in the careful and graceful art that is creating bread.

To begin, a user only needs to specify which style of bread they are creating and the app will guide them through the process, offering timers, tips, and push notifications to be able to help users in becoming the best BreadWinner they can be.
